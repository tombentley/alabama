"""A JSON-based serialization library. This module can be used to 
   serialize and deserialize Ceylon object graphs to/from JSON.
   
   Efforts are made to make the JSON reasonably idiomatic, 
   while still supporting things like cyclic Ceylon 
   instance graphs.
   
   The API offered by this module is to serialize/deserialize a 
   single instance, called the root instance. In practice this is 
   not really a limitation because you can always serialize a single 
   sequence of several other instances. 
   
   # Serialized form
   
   ## 'Simple' classes
   
   An instance of a simple class will serialize to a JSON object. 
   Given the class
   
       class Person(first, last) {
           shared String first;
           shared String last;
       }
   
   we could serialize an instance like this:
   
       value johnDoe = Person(!"John", "Doe");
       value json = serialize(johnDoe);
   
   The JSON will look like this: 
       
   ```javascript
   {
     "first":"John",
     "last":"Doe"
   }
   ```
   
   There are some built in special cases:
   
   * Ceylon `String` and `Character` instances map to/from JSON strings,
   * Ceylon `Integer` and `Float` instances map to/from JSON numbers,
   * Ceylon `Boolean` instances map to/from JSON true or false,
   * Ceylon's `Null` instance maps to/from JSON's null,
   * Ceylon `Array` and `Sequential`s map to/from the JSON array
     notation (with type information added if this would 
     result in ambiguity during deserialization).
   
   In all other cases instances are decomposed into their constituent 
   references.
   
   ## Including type information
   
   Consider deserializing the above example JSON again:
   
   ```javascript
   {
     "first":"John",
     "last":"Doe"
   }
   ```
   
   Note that it does not include information about the Ceylon class
   which was serialized to produce this JSON.
   
   If the deserializing client knows *a priori* that it is deserializing 
   JSON representing a `Person`, the it is not necessary to include the 
   type information in the JSON itself. Such a client can deserialize 
   it like this:
   
       value person = deserialize<Person>(json);
       
   Note the explicit type argument to `deserialize<>()`!
   
   If we know the deserializing client does not know the type of object 
   it will be deserializing we need to include more type information in the 
   JSON.
   
   Examples of when such additional type 
   information is needed include:
   
   * Where the root instance's type is not statically known at the 
     point of deserialization
     (for example if the receiver knows it will only be deserializing 
     `Person` instances it is not necessary to include type information,
     but if they can deserialize `Person|Organsiation` then the message
     needs to discriminate which). 
   * Where a non-root instance is referred to via an attribute with a 
     wider type then the instance type. For example
     
          class Consignment(shipTo) {
              shared Person|Company shipTo;
              // ...
          }
   
   Whatever the cause, we can include such type information by calling 
   serialize like this:
   
       value json = serialize<Object>(johnDoe);
       
   Note the explicit type argument in the call to `serialize()`!
   
   [[By default|TypeExpressionTypeNaming]] the type 
   information is included as an additional JSON "class" property:
   
   ```javascript
   {
     "class":"example:Person",
     "first":"John",
     "last":"Doe"
   }
   ```
   
   As an alternative to using type expressions for the "class" value, 
   the serializing client and deserializing client can agree 
   beforehand a bijective type->name mapping allowing arbitrary names can be 
   used, see [[LogicalTypeNaming]].
   
   ## Identity
   
   Ceylon instances and the instances they refer to form a directed graph. 
   JSON provides a tree-like syntax. So we have to 
   handle the possibility of an instance being referred-to multiple 
   times. Moreover there is also the possibility of cyclic instance graphs, 
   where an instance refers (possibly indirectly) to itself.
   
   To best handle arbitrary object graphs this module assigns ids to 
   instances which occur more than once in the object graph. During 
   serialization the first occurence of the instance is serialized as normal, 
   but with an extra id key, and subsequent occurences refer to that id.
   
   For example given the class:
    
       class Twice(Person inst) {
           shared Person first=inst;
           shared Person second=inst;
       }
        
   and the instance `Twice(john, john)` (where `john` is the `Person` above)
   then the JSON output would look like this:
    
   ```javascript
   {
     "first": { "#":1, first":"John", "second":"Doe" },
     "@second: 1
   }
   ```
    
   The `Person` has an extra `#` JSON key and subsequent references to that 
   instance use property names prefixed with `@` and with that id value.
